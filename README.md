## Catriona Bennett

Having spent over 16 years in retail it was time for a change of direction. Having already done some work with HTML (self taught), I used to look after 3 websites! Two were originally in word and I redid both in HTML. The third was redone by someone else and I learnt a lot from seeing their code and that helped me improve the ones I was working on. This combined with me being thorough in my work led to a close friend suggesting programming. I started to teach myself C# and then quickly moved to Python to get a better understanding of coding. I found I was really enjoying it and in particular seeing the end result! I knew this would be a good job to do going forwards and that's how I ended up at Makers Academy. My preference is for front end as seeing the end result is really what motivates me!

## Skills

#### Organised

Through my time in Stock Control at Tesco and being secretary of two clubs at the same time meant organisation was key for me to get everything done. Working in an organised and methodical manner comes naturally to me!

#### Good team worker

Being in Stock Control I worked in small team but we had to work together as otherwise we wouldn't get everything done! I was my manager's right hand person for several years and quite often if my colleagues had a problem, they would come to me for help rather than my manager!

#### Adaptable

I'm very adaptable and during my time at Tesco, one minute I could be doing my work and the next having to help out on another department. After leaving Tesco, I did temp work and never knew from one week to the next what I'd be doing.

- I used a PDA to my job and invariably I was the one that ended up fixing them if they went wrong. When we had new PDAs delivered I showed my colleagues how to use them and I also helped them to put staff apps onto their phones.

I do Scottish Country Dancing, follow various sports and enjoy continuing to learn programming. I'm also trying to learn Hungarian.
