## Catriona Bennett

Having spent over 16 years in retail it was time for a change of direction. Having already done some work with HTML (self taught), I used to look after 3 websites! Two were originally in word and I redid both in HTML. The third was redone by someone else and I learnt a lot from seeing their code and that helped me improve the ones I was working on. This combined with me being thorough in my work led to a close friend suggesting programming. I started to teach myself C# and then quickly moved to Python to get a better understanding of coding. I found I was really enjoying it and in particular seeing the end result! I knew this would be a good job to do going forwards and that's how I ended up at Makers Academy. Originally I thought my preference would be for frontend but as the course has gone on, I've realised just how much I enjoy doing the logic etc, so now it's backend that I prefer!

## Skills

#### Organised

Through my time in Stock Control at Tesco and being secretary of two clubs at the same time meant organisation was key for me to get everything done. Working in an organised and methodical manner comes naturally to me!

#### Good team worker

Being in Stock Control I worked in small team but we had to work together as otherwise we wouldn't get everything done! I was my manager's right hand person for several years and quite often if my colleagues had a problem, they would come to me for help rather than my manager!

#### Adaptable

I'm very adaptable and during my time at Tesco, one minute I could be doing my work and the next having to help out on another department. After leaving Tesco, I did temp work and never knew from one week to the next what I'd be doing.

## Experience

**The Best Connection** (September 2019 to March 2020)    
*Retail assistant (agency staff)*

**Dance Teacher** (September 2011 - present)
- For the first 2 years I would take a Scottish Dance class if the regular teacher was unavailable for any reason. In September 2013 I took over the beginners class and taught it every week that it ran, until December 2018 when the classes merged. While teaching this class, and since then, I occasionally take evenings for other clubs.
- It should be noted in all cases I am teaching adults and if children are present, their parents/guardians are also present.

**Tesco** (March 2003 to May 2019)   
*Stock Controller*  
- I used a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to do my job and invariably I was the one that ended up fixing them if they went wrong. Usually this just entailed me doing different types of reboots and if these different work, then I would report them by phoning helpdesk so that could be swapped out. When we had new PDAs delivered I showed my colleagues how to use them and I also helped them to put staff apps onto their phones.
- My job involved counting stock, cubing products, printing missing shelf edge labels, re-merchandising where necessary, mapping and investigating stock levels. So essentially I was trouble shooting internal hardware to manage stock and supporting the use of internal hardware.
- I would also step into team leader / manager roles when required.

## Hobbies

I do Scottish Country Dancing, follow various sports and enjoy continuing to learn programming. I have had some wonderful opportunities through the dancing including participating at the Patron's Lunch! I'm also trying to learn Hungarian.
